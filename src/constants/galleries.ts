The first installer referred the job to us as it was a particularly challenging setup, and we had a brief window in which to operate. In a matter of days we were able to analyze and solve the problems, run hundreds of feet of cable through the overheads and out through the lobbies without leaving a trace. We accomplished all the work and kept the management and staff updated and informed.",
